  description: Currently the only planet that houses organic and intelligent life,
    where 70% of it is covered in water. Every condition is suitable for us to exist
    which is considered a cosmic fluke (at least for now) because we haven't been
    contacted by any other intelligent life form and we haven't been able to contact
    anyone outside ofour blue marvel marble.

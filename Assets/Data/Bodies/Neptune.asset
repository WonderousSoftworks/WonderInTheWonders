  description: Neptune has a very harsh climate. Large storms whirl through its upper
    atmosphere, and high-speed winds track around the planet at up 600 meters per
    second. One of the largest storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. It was called
    the Great Dark Spot. It lasted about five years.
